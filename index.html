    <h1 id="h1">The Midpoint Formula</h1>
        <p>
            The Midpoint Formula is used to locate the exact middle
            distance between two objects, or two locations. 
            <br><br>
            It is typically implemented when it's the  easiest to use: 
            <br>
            when you have images that are sketched
            on a grid or coordinate plane. 
            <br>
            This is because there are 
            units of length created when we superimpose an image on
            a grid and it makes calculations such as length very simple to make.
        </p>

    <p id="inputs1">
        To locate a point (x, y) at the exact middle of a segment on a coordinate plane, average 
        each pair of corresponding coordinates to calculate the midpoint's location at: (x<sub>m</sub>, y<sub>m</sub>) 
        <br> 
        where m = "midpoint".

                    If you recall in math, calculating the average of two numbers will give you
                    the number in the middle of your two values. 
                    <br>
                    For an everyday example, if you got an 80% on a test and a 100% on a second 
                    test, the teacher will typically average the two scores and give you an overall grade 
                    equal to that amount. This is the programming used behind the Gradebook Technology
                    your teacher uses and the grades you earn in your classes. 
                    <br>
                        <div id="soWhat">
                            <p>
                                So what would your new grade be after the two scores are averaged?
                                <br>
                                It would be a 90% A-! Awesome!
                            </p>
                                <img src="images/sickday.png" alt="sickday" id="sickDay" />
                            <p>
                                So what would your grade be if you were absent and missed the third test?? 
                                What would a zero being added into an 'Average' calculation do to your grade?
                                <br><br>
                                Let's investigate this. You would think it's just going to be the sum of your previous answer
                                with a new value of 0%. 
                                <br><br>
                                Resulting in the following calculation, and resultant grade in the class:
                                <br><br>
                                90% + 0% = 90% 
                                <br>
                                90% Ã· 2 = 45% F 
                                <br> Ouch! That's not good. 
                                <br><br>
                                So missing one test, can take your grade from a 90% A- to 45% F!!!  
                                <br><br>
                                Is this the same answer we would get if we started back at the beginning of the problem
                                and considered the entire problem as a whole? Including all three test scores at once?
                                <br>
                                Well, let's investigate:
                                80%, 100%, and a 0% are the three test scores.
                                <br><br>
                                The "Laws of Averaging" state: To calculate the average of more than two numbers,
                                you must divide the sum of your numbers by how many numbers you sum. 
                                <br>
                                So in this instance, we have three test scores. Therefore, we will divide the 
                                sum of the scores by 3.
                                <br><br>
                                80% + 100% + 0% = 180%
                                <br>
                                180% Ã· 3 = 60% D- hmmmm
                                <br>
                                Why are we getting two different answers? Personally i'd like get the second grade if it were me...
                                60%! Atleast I'd still be passing.... ðŸ˜…
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Long story short, its because PEMDAS comes into play due to multiple operations 
                                (adding and dividing) being present in the same calculation. 
                                <br> 
                                A rule that applies to fractions and PEMDAS is:
                                <br><br>
                            </p>
                            <p id="rule">
                                Always combine the numerator values into one term <span style="text-decoration: underline">BEFORE</span> 
                                dividing that total by the denominator.
